DNA String alignment using Dynamic Programming.

Just a simple demonstration of how a dynamic programming algorithm can be used to find good DNA string alignments. More information about the algorithm used in this program can be found in the 3rd Edition Cormen's (dynamic algorithm section) book about Algorithms.
